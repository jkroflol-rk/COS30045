        <h2>Age Group distribution</h2>
        <p>
          Age groups play a significant role in various aspects of society,
          including healthcare, education, marketing, and policy-making.
          Understanding the demographics of different age cohorts allows
          organizations and governments to tailor their services, products, and
          initiatives to meet the specific needs and preferences of each group.
          From the exuberance and curiosity of children to the wisdom and
          experience of seniors, each age group brings its own set of
          characteristics, challenges, and opportunities. By recognizing and
          respecting the diversity within age demographics, societies can foster
          inclusivity, promote intergenerational understanding, and create
          environments that support the well-being and success of individuals
          across the lifespan.
